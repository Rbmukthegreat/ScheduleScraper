idea for constraints:
add a LUNCH_ENCLOSURES string that would look like this: "10:30-12:30" that would specify when lunch COULD be
add a LEN_LUNCH float that would specify how long lunch would be (in hours)
to check that this is correct:
  add ALL schedules to the list
  after doing so, get all classes that would overlap with LUNCH_ENCLOSURES
  finally, check the time between those classes--something like secondclass_start - firstclass_end, and see if it is >= len_lunch
  if so, either continue, but if at last day (friday) add to the list of possible schedules
  
do this instead of setting lunch to be at a certain time everyday--because that might sink the possibilities down to 0 on the day that it matters.
